# üõçÔ∏è SQL_RETAIL
## üìò Project Overview

SQL_RETAIL is an end-to-end retail sales analysis project using MySQL.
It includes data cleaning, exploration, and advanced SQL queries to extract business insights such as profit, customer behavior, category performance, and sales trends.

## üßπ Data Cleaning
To find and handle missing or incorrect data values before performing analysis.
Missing or blank values can lead to inaccurate insights, so identifying them early is crucial.
```
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
OR sale_date IS NULL
OR sale_time IS NULL
OR customer_id IS NULL
OR gender IS NULL 
OR age IS NULL
OR category IS NULL
OR quantity IS NULL
OR price_per_unit IS NULL
OR cogs IS NULL 
OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

To check if there are any records with blank strings ('', ' ', 'NULL') instead of real NULL values ‚Äî a common data quality issue.

```
SELECT age, LENGTH(age)
FROM retail_sales
WHERE age = '' OR age = ' ' OR age = 'NULL';
```

### üìä Data Exploration

1Ô∏è‚É£ To calculate the total revenue (sum of all sales) in the dataset.
```
SELECT SUM(total_sale) FROM retail_sales;
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Total Number of Transactions
- To count how many transactions occurred in total ‚Äî helps understand dataset volume.
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM retail_sales;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Unique Customers

```

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers FROM retail_sales;
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Total Categories
- To identify all unique product categories available in the dataset.

FROM day_name
GROUP BY Day_name, Month
ORDER BY Highest_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
Ô∏è```
Q1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ How much profit got in each year
- To calculate annual profit by subtracting the total cost of goods sold (COGS) from total sales.
```

GROUP BY years
ORDER BY profit DESC;
```
Q1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Which product purchased less in which year
